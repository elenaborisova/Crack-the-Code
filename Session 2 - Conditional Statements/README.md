|7.99               |(no output)        |



## 2.	Find the greater number

*Example input and output*
|       Input       |      Output       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|5<br>3                  |5                 |
|3<br>5                  |5                 |
|10<br>10                |(no output)       |
|-5<br>-10               |-5                |



## 3.	Odd or Even

|1024                  |even                |


## 4.	Number from 100 to 200
Write a program which reads an integer number from the user and checks whether the number is under 100, between 100 and 200, or above 200. 

*Example input and output*
|       Input       |      Output       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|95                  |Less than 100                 |
|120                  |Between 100 and 200                 |
|210                  |Greater than 200                 |


## 5.	Guess the password
Write a program which reads a password (a string) from the user and checks whether it is the same as "s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd". If it is the same, print “Welcome”, if it is not – print “Wrong password!”.

*Example input and output*
|       Input       |      Output       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|qwerty                  |Wrong password!                 |
|s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd                  |Welcome                 |
|s3cr3t!p@ss                  |Wrong password!                 |


## 6.	Area of different shapes
Write a program which reads the type and side of a geometric shape and calculates its area. The shapes can be 4 types: square, rectangle, circle, and triangle. The first line of input should be the type.
•	If the type is square, the next line of input should be one number – its side;
•	If the type is rectangle, the next 2 lines should read 2 numbers – 2 sides of the rectangle; 
•	If the type is circle, the next line of input should be one number – its radius; 
•	If the type is triangle, the next 2 lines should read 2 numbers – the side and height of the triangle; 

The result should be rounded to 3 digits after the decimal. 

*Example input and output*
|       Input       |      Output       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|square<br>5                  |25.000                 |
|rectangle<br>7<br>2.5                  |17.500                 |
|circle<br>6                  |113.097                 |
|triangle<br>4.5<br>20                  |45.000                 |
