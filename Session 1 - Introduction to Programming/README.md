•	"The architect {name} will need {needed hours} hours to complete {number of projects} project/s."

*Example input and output*  
|       Input       |      Output       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|George<br>4          |The architect George will need 12 hours to complete 4 project/s.          |
|Sanya<br>9                  |The architect Sanya will need 27 hours to complete 9 project/s.                  |

  
  
## 8.	Pets store

*Input*   
1.	Square meters needed for the construction – floating point number.

*Output*  
•	"The final price is: {final_price} euros."
•	"The discount is: {discount} euros."

*Example input and output*  
|       Input       |      Output       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|550          |The final price is:  3432.11 lv.<br>The discount is: 753.39 lv.         |
|150                  |The final price is: 936.03 lv.<br>The discount is: 205.47 lv.                  |
